## Wotlk hunter's configs

This repository is a bookguide with macros and weakauras made for hunters. Notice that you can find some generic stuff for survivals and marksman hunters in different folders.

On the other hand, you can also find a repository with some profiles for both speccs to be used in hunter's simulator. This is only to help you settings up the simulator to min-max your dps.
