## Marksmanship Hunter Macros:

#### Shot Macro w/ Kill Command & Silencing Shot:

> **Note:**Replace <the name of the shot here> here with Chimera Shot / Aimed Shot / Multi-Shot / Arcane Shot / Steady Shot.
[group:raid] allows the Silencing Shot to only be cast in raid groups. If your using the same macro for BGs you might want to remove the Silencing Shot portion
and use it seperatelly to benifit from debuff.
